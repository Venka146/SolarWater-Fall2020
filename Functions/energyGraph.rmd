## Solar Panel Energy Systems Intro

This is an R markdown document for the Energy Graph associated with our Solar Panel Energy System. The graph takes in temperature of the environment, length of simulation, and solar panel energy system data. 

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
  sim_temp <- 25
  sim_length <- 5
  hours <- c(0:sim_length)
  energy <- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0)
  data <- data.frame(timeVals = hours,
                     energyVals = energy)
```

## Graph

The graph below illustrates the energy in the system throughout the specified simulation time period. 

```{r graph, echo = FALSE}
energyGraph(data, sim_temp)
```
