## Solar Panel Energy Systems Intro

This is an R markdown document for the Energy Graph associated with our Solar Panel Energy System. The graph takes in temperature of the environment, length of simulation, and solar panel energy system data. 

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
  sim_temp <- 25
  sim_length <- 5
  scNum <- 5
  scPow <- 6
  
  data <- gen_energy_vals(scNum, scPow, sim_length)
    
  
```

## Graph

The graph below illustrates the energy in the system throughout the specified simulation time period. 

```{r graph, echo = FALSE}
energyGraph(data, sim_temp)
```
